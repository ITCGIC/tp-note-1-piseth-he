```

### Task 2
Implement an application Java that take a given number of seconds for converting into time with format `Hours:Minutes:Seconds`. 

(class must named `Task2`) 

Example

```
Program for converting seconds into formated H:M:S
  Input number of seconds: 1259
  Time corresponding to 1259seconds is 00:20:59.
```

### Task 3
Write a program in Java to a Time (hours, minutes, seconds) to number of seconds. Hours, minutes and seconds are inputed from keyboard.  

(class must named `Task3`)

Example:

```
Program for converting time to seconds.
  Please input hours: 20
  Please input minutes: 30
  Please input seconds: 50
  
--------------------------------------------------
  Number of seconds = 20x3600 + 30x60 + 50 = 73850
```

### Task 4
Write a program in Java to calculate cost of calling with given Time Start (hours, minutes, and seconds) and Time End (hours, minutes, and seconds). The cost of call per minute is 0.05$. The program will display total number of minutes called and total cost of the call. 

(class must named `Task4`)
 
Example:

```
Program for calculating cost of a call.
  Please input start hours: 20
  Please input start minutes: 30
  Please input start seconds: 50
  Please input end hours: 20
  Please input end minutes: 35
  Please input end seconds: 5
  
----------------------------------------- 
 Total call duration: 0h 4mn 15s
 Total cost of this call: 0.2125$
```

### Task 5
Write a program in Java to money in Riels to Dollar. Suppose that conversion rate is 1$ = 4000 Riels.

(class must named `Task5`)

Example:

```
Program for converting money in Riels to Dollars.
  Conversion rate is: 1 USD = 4000 RIELS
  Please input money in Riels: 2200

-------------------------------------------------
  2200 RIELS = 0.55 USD
```
